# About me
How I Started in Data Analysis:

Upon completing my professional degree in Nanotechnology and Renewable Energies Engineering at the University of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges in securing employment opportunities. While actively applying to companies, I decided to utilize my free time by delving into an area I had always seen as a personal challenge - programming. This led me to discover the vast world of IT. 
I began hearing about data analysis and a different language used to work with databases. This marked the inception of my career in data analysis, through online courses during quarantine, I acquired foundational knowledge. Presently, I am furthering my education through a Diploma in Data Engineering and Analysis at the Canadian College of Technology and Business in Vancouver, Canada.
